comparison:
  # Identity fields used to align BOQ lines to actual lines.
  # These are logical identifiers only; domain semantics are defined in higher layers.
  identity_fields:
    - item_code
    - cost_code

  # How to interpret costs when comparing:
  # - total_cost: use the provided total_cost only
  # - quantity_unit_cost: derive cost from quantity * unit_cost only
  # - prefer_total_cost: use total_cost when present, else quantity * unit_cost
  cost_basis: prefer_total_cost

  # Optional breakdown grouping (e.g., "category" like labor/materials/etc).
  # This is purely a data-driven dimension: values must be present in `identity`
  # or `attributes` on each CostLine (no inference performed).
