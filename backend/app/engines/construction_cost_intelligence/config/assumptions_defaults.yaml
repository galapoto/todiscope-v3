# Default Assumptions Configuration for Construction Cost Intelligence Engine
# 
# This file documents default assumptions used in variance detection and time-phased reporting.
# These assumptions are automatically included in evidence payloads and report outputs.

variance_detection:
  # Default severity thresholds (as percentages)
  thresholds:
    tolerance: 5.0      # Within tolerance threshold
    minor: 10.0         # Minor variance threshold
    moderate: 25.0      # Moderate variance threshold
    major: 50.0         # Major variance threshold
  
  # Default categorization
  category_field: null  # Field name for variance categorization (null = no categorization)
  
  # Standard exclusions (what the engine does not do)
  exclusions:
    - id: "no_causality"
      category: "causality"
      description: "Engine does not determine causes of cost variances"
      rationale: "Variance analysis is descriptive only; root cause analysis requires domain expertise"
    
    - id: "no_decisions"
      category: "decisions"
      description: "Engine does not make budget approval or project management decisions"
      rationale: "Engine provides analytical signals only; decisions are human responsibility"
    
    - id: "no_budget_revision"
      category: "budget_approval"
      description: "Engine does not revise or approve budgets"
      rationale: "Budget approval is a management decision; engine only reports variance signals"
    
    - id: "no_cost_control"
      category: "cost_control"
      description: "Engine does not implement cost control measures"
      rationale: "Engine is analytical only; cost control actions are operational responsibility"

time_phased_reporting:
  # Default period type
  period_type: "monthly"  # Options: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
  
  # Default date field for extraction
  date_field: "date_recorded"  # Field name in CostLine.attributes
  
  # Default cost calculation preference
  prefer_total_cost: true  # If true, prefer total_cost over quantity * unit_cost
  
  # Standard exclusions (same as variance detection)

# Evidence linkage configuration
