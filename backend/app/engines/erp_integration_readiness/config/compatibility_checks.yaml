# Compatibility check exclusions
exclusions:
  - id: "no_live_testing"
    category: "testing"
    description: "Engine does not perform live connectivity or performance testing"
    rationale: "Engine assesses configuration compatibility only; live testing requires operational environment"
  
  - id: "no_network_probing"
    category: "network"
    description: "Engine does not probe network connectivity or measure latency"
    rationale: "Engine assesses configuration only; network testing requires operational environment"
  
  - id: "no_security_audit"
    category: "security"
    description: "Engine does not perform security audits or penetration testing"
    rationale: "Engine assesses configuration compatibility only; security audits require specialized tools"
