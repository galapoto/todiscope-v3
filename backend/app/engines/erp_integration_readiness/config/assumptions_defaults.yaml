# Default Assumptions Configuration for ERP Integration Readiness Engine
# 
# This file documents default assumptions used in ERP system integration readiness checks.
# These assumptions are automatically included in evidence payloads and report outputs.

readiness_checks:
  # Default severity thresholds for readiness issues
  severity_thresholds:
    high: "high"      # Issues that prevent integration
    medium: "medium"  # Issues that may cause problems
    low: "low"        # Issues that are warnings
  
  # Standard exclusions (what the engine does not do)
